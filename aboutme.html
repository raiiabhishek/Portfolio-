                <h2> Student, Photographer</h2>
                <p>I am a driven and motivated IT student with a thirst for knowledge. My passion for technology and desire to learn new things has led me down the path of IT, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.
                    Aside from my studies, I am also a photographer who has honed my skills through self-teaching and practice. My favorite type of photography is portrait photography, as I enjoy capturing the unique beauty and character of each individual I photograph. I often travel to new and exciting places to gather inspiration and find new subjects to photograph.
                    I am also a creative individual who has a passion for editing and enhancing my photos and videos. I enjoy the process of taking an ordinary image and transforming it into something extraordinary. Whether it's adjusting the lighting, color grading, or adding special effects, I find joy in bringing out the best in my work.
                    Music has always been a big part of my life and I enjoy playing the guitar in my free time. This is a creative outlet that allows me to relax and express myself in a unique way.
                    In the future, I hope to turn my passions into a career as a graphic designer. I believe that my IT background, creativity, and artistic abilities will serve me well in this field. I am excited to continue learning, growing, and pursuing my dreams.</p>
